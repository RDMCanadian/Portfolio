Welcome, please take a look at my work and read the remainder of this file, and bear in mind that I am a starting out and rather new 'Developer', even saying that right now feels like a lie, but I would like to sharpen my skills and earn the title of 'Developer' Thank you for looking!

About Me:
Having played FiveM since I was around 10, and games since I was younger, I've always wanted to learn how to make games and how people were able to make things happen in games, but now that I've started my journey, I see how people have done it and I'd like to continue and become one of those people that I've looked up to and admired. I know that this will take a long time, and I fully understand and grasp that, but I have to start somewhere, so why not FiveM?

Portfolio Overview:
Within my Github repository, you should see some of my work. Please keep in mind that this is what I have worked on since the beginning of my FiveM Development Journey, and I am always looking to make my work better and more clear!

Always Learning:
There is always time and room to learn more, as in todays day and age having skills in development is one of the biggest things you can have!

Technical Stuff:
Throughout my journey, I've been picking up a few languages, including Python, Lua, and JavaScript, but I'm always looking to learn more and sharpen my skills.
