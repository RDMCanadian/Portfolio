# Welcome

Thank you for taking the time to explore my work. As I’m still early in my development journey, I want to share my experiences and growth as I sharpen my skills and earn the title of "Developer." It feels surreal to say that right now, but I’m dedicated to getting there, and your interest is greatly appreciated!

## About Me

I’ve been passionate about games for as long as I can remember, having played FiveM since I was around 10 years old. My fascination with how games work and how developers make things happen in them has always been a driving force. Now that I’ve started my development journey, I’ve realized how much goes into it, and I aspire to be one of those developers I’ve always looked up to. I understand that the road will take time, but I’m excited to begin—and FiveM is where it all starts for me.

As I continue to grow, I’m working on making my projects more professional, developing my skills, and gradually transitioning to more complex development work.

## Portfolio Overview

Within my GitHub repository, you’ll find some of my work so far. Keep in mind that these are projects from the start of my FiveM development journey, and I’m continuously working to improve and make my code clearer and more efficient. I’m always striving to better my skills and my output.

## Always Learning

In today’s fast-paced world, development skills are more important than ever. There is always something new to learn, and I’m dedicated to constantly improving and staying on top of new trends and tools in development.

## Technical Stuff

Throughout my journey, I’ve picked up several languages including **Python**, **Lua**, and **JavaScript**, but I’m always open to learning more. I want to continue building my skills and expanding my knowledge so I can create better projects and contribute more to the community.
